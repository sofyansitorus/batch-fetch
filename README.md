#### batchFetch

`batchFetch` is a function designed to batch multiple fetch requests and handle them collectively. This is particularly useful when you need to make several API requests at once and handle their responses together.

#### Usage

```javascript
batchFetch(url: string, options: RequestInit): Promise<Response>
```

- `url`: The URL to fetch.
- `options`: An object containing any custom settings that you want to apply to the request.

#### Example

```javascript
const url = 'https://api.example.com/data';
const options = {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
};

batchFetch(url, options)
    .then(response => {
        // Handle response
    })
    .catch(error => {
        // Handle error
    });
```

#### How it Works

- **Registering Requests**: When you call `batchFetch`, it registers the request along with its options and assigns a unique `batchId` to it.

- **Event Listeners**: It adds event listeners for `'batchFetchThen'` and `'batchFetchCatch'` events. These events are triggered when the response is received or an error occurs for any of the registered requests.

- **Signal Handling**: If the `options` include a `signal` for aborting the request, it sets up an event listener for the `'abort'` event. This allows for graceful handling of aborted requests.

- **Processing Responses**: When a response is received, it increments the `processed` counter for the corresponding request. If all requests are processed, it unregisters the batch.

- **Handling Errors**: If an error occurs, it rejects the promise with the error. Similarly, it removes event listeners and handles the abort signal, if any.

#### Notes

- Make sure to handle errors appropriately in your code, as this function will reject the promise if any of the requests fail.

- Ensure that the `options` parameter is properly configured according to the Fetch API specifications.

- The `signal` property in `options` is optional, but it's recommended to include it for better control over request cancellation.
